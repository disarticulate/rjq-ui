                  title="Fancy word for a beetle.">scarabaeus</span> hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed
        to fall, would have fallen at our feet. Legrand immediately took the scythe, and cleared with it a circular
        space, three or four yards in diameter, just beneath the insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered Jupiter
        to let go the string and come down from the tree.
